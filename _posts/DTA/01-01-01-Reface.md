7, or to turn on the `tremolo` and move each of the DEPTH and RATE settings to around 5.


###### RdII
piano voice from the late 1970s. Compared with the Rdl, it has a characteristically bright, high-fidelity sound.

###### Classical Piano


# Knobes

###### Tremolo
Modulates the volume in a cyclical fashion.
When [TYPE] is set to `Rdl`, `Rdll`, or `CP`
- The sound will be cyclically panned left and right in stereo.
When [TYPE] is set to `Wr`,`Clv,` or `Toy`:
- The volume will be cyclically varied up and down

###### Wah
Modulates the filter cutoff frequency based on the input volume.
This produces a cyclical change in tone

y-2. [DEPTH] knob
Increases the effect on the sound when turned
clockwise.
 With tremolo
When [TYPE] is set to Rdl, Rdll, or
CP:
Adjusts the degree to which the sound is
modulated left and right.
When [TYPE] is set to Wr, Clv, or
Toy:
Adjusts the degree to which the volume is
modulated.

y-3. [RATE] knob
Increases the effect on the sound when turned
clockwise.
 With tremolo
Adjusts the speed of modulation.
 With wah
Adjusts the resonance offset value. This
changes the character of the modulated
sound.

# Power

`Amps` - electrons to cassy electricity (water)  =  how much electric charge pass point in one sec. - current (in `A` amps)
`Voltage` - electrical pressuere current need energy to move . Flow from - to + = from power company = 220 eu 120 us

`I` (amps) x `V` (volts) = `W` (watt) how much ennergy per time - power
kWh - how much energy used in 1h

PA-130 - power supply - DC IN (12 V) jack   (0.7A)

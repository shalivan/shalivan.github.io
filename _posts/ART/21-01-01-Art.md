# Informal Rules of creativity

## Approach

- Find the most interesting `question` that you can barely answer.
- Don't save on means. Hardware and `tools` defining your way.  
- Make `notes` (with possible solutions).
- Even bad ideas can have nice `execution`
- `Learn` the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist. -  Picasso
- `Stories`:  we create value in things that have no inherent value. Whole art industry is based on deciding which canvas isvaluable, based on story.
- Ideas are beautiful when they realize the `premises`
- have a `singular goal` but in `team play`: u must have a charisma and luck to get everyone on board with a vision
- when intellectual framework of how thing are done is set u have a rapid progress  entering the new paradigm is  super hard...
- to learn how to draw you must learn how to `see`. 
- **Deep work** cognitively demanding task vs. **Shallow work** logistical in nature. Responding

## Mindset

- `Don't make excuses`.  
- `Understanding` Understand medium
- `Strong visual library` Help with finding patterns.
- `Practice` - training is the most efficient way to have progress
- `Perseverance`. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- `Habits` help to free your mind of thinking about basics. Rhythms have benefits
- `Control attention span`. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.
- `Knowledge` , culture, anatomy, light, help with understanding to know what you want.
- if you want to be better you must accumulate a lot of training data to cancel wrong data, and you must pinpoint attention on things you want to improve so you can reinforce it.
- Reasoning  changes immediately with results, and doing next steps
- Protect time and space  you work
- hazards of "self-consciousness" when considering the key factors influencing a design.
- look at  big picture to see if major story points are clear
- Magic happen `out of comfort zone`
- How far is ceiling and then optimize  

##### Architect vs. Gardener
Styles of work differ. Architect is planning everything in advance and gardener is trying to make while progressing through.

## Planning  
- What's the focus of the image
- Check `anchors` and `restrictions`
- `constraints` can give objectives reason to implement solutions.
- Identify possible `obstacles` that can interrupt or slow you down.
- Use `limitations as strengths`.
- Make it `simple`, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  (keep things simple and complex)
- Work on main issues and resolve `core problems`.  
- Break `complex problems` into pieces. If u can quantify u can overcome it.
- `Pipelines` - to make data and information flow through easily and prevent bottlenecks.
- `Automate` processes. Keep things `procedural` as long as you can for quick fixes.
- `tools` to organize and automate make it easier
- Have a `crumple zone` to be able to reduce scope.
- `R'n'D` - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
- Quid pro quo `time vs detail` precision and nuance creates fidelity
- Development means `Iterations`
- Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to
- easy part is doing, hard part is planning.
- ideas are cheap

### Production pipelines

- Film: Preproduction > Production > Post-Production  (Alex McDowell - world building)
- Arch: Pre Design, Schematic > Design > Construction
- In changing env: Observe > Orient > Decide(feedback) > Act (feedback) ( OODA Loop   - decision-making that focuses on filtering available information,)
- General design process: Empathize > Define > Ideate > Prototype > test



# Artistic Merits

quality - is subjective 
meaning - is not subjective 


Art - from artificial is in opposition to nature.  Expression. (Something to say, theme or issue.) intentional bringing idea: making internal > external  
Games were not classified as art (def by free speech  in us constitutions) because it was mechanics (no merit)  and is not expressive. (like pineball or sports)

ART:
THINGS MENT TO BE EXPERIENCED, OR MENT TO BE CONSUME.

material culture OBJECTS
- sum of total culture products
- physical , manufact obj utilitarian obj

visual culture  IDEAS
- sumo of total of how a culture visualizes itself
- worldview/ religion / ethnicity, culture
Canon - system or set of rules governing arts. Flexible but crucial


`Form` + `Function` + `Content` < `Context` < Critical Approach
- Function over Form  - EASIER - (have silhouette / bbox and add details )
- Form over Function - HARDER - create new form from rules of how sth should work.

**Context** - Observe: - how things relate to each other

### Artist vs. Viewer
Artist's intention and the viewer's interpretation.
Architects, unlike many artists, often have a clear functional goal. Art appreciation is a journey, not a destination. By considering both the artist's background  and intention and your own reaction, you can unlock a richer understanding and enjoyment of any work of art. Sometimes we have evidence about artist intentions - maby sometimes artis did a bad work 


Expressive - Artist's intention and emotional expression
- **Intention:** Artists often create with a specific message or feeling they want to evoke. This "intention" can be a starting point for understanding the artwork.

Phenomenological - Viewer's experience and perception of the artwork
- **Death of the Author:** This theory argues that once a piece of art is created, its meaning becomes independent of the artist's original intent. Viewers bring their own experiences and perspectives, shaping their understanding of the work.

### Value of culture

 Art Shape Our Worldview and Culture
**Stories Shape Meaning:**
**Meaning Shapes Culture:**
**Culture Shapes Us:**

- **Narrative Loop:** Provides a clear cyclical model for understanding the ongoing influence of stories on culture.
- **Lenses of Interpretation:** Highlights how diverse stories shape our individual and collective perceptions of the world.
- **Evolutionary Framework:** Offers a compelling explanation for how stories can play a role in cultural survival and adaptation.
- **Cognitive Framework:** Explores the psychological benefits of stories in helping us understand and navigate the world.
- **Social Identity Framework:** Sheds light on the role of stories in creating group identity and belonging.
- **Experiential Framework:** Emphasizes the power of stories to foster empathy and shared understanding across cultures.
- **Ritual and Performance Framework:** Explains how actively performing stories reinforces their impact on cultural values.

If you change story > change meaning you see in the world > change world 
Anything you went born knowing what to do you learned by culture.
Culture is spirit of society  
Culture is defined by hierarchies of values (co w jakich warunkach jest ważne)
